# SQSF
React practice

## Required Set up
- .env variables
  - ZWSID = personal zwsid number

## To Set up in Developer mode

To build and watch
```
npm run watch
```

To run the dev server (nodemon)
```
npm run dev
```

## TODOS
- Nav spacing / dynamic resizing
- convert components/Listing to a presentational component
- set up dev environment
- set up redux for better handling of api/mock data
- pagination redux is zero based, Haven't decided if that is a good idea

## Issues
- Google maps API error. [Tracked](issuetracker.google.com/issues/63211698)
```
Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event.
 ```
